# Salary classification

Classify indivisual salary into >50K or <=50K

## Getting Started

This project is inspired by a UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset called Census Income dataset. The aim of the dataset is to classify whether a person has salary greater than 50k or less than 50k based on different attributes of the person. For more information about the Dataset please see the links in Dataset section. The codes are self explanatory but if you need help comments are there in the [notebook](/Salary\ Classification) itself. The comment free version of the code is also available on this [notebook(to be uploaded...)](). You can open the notebook on Google colab using the link available in this [notebook(to be uploaded...)]()

## Dataset links

The link to original page is [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) at UCI machine learning repository.

Download page at UCI Machine Learning repository is [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/) and dataset [description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.names)

The data is also available in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/niwech/census-income-dataset)

The direct link to [download](https://www.kaggle.com/niwech/census-income-dataset/download) the dataset from kaggle.

After downloading the data place it(adult.data) in Dataset folder on the same directory.

## Prerequisites
If you have all the necessary library along with jupyter notebook setup on your system you can just clone the repo and start working on the project.

you can also work with Google Colab with link given in getting started section

To setup this notebook on your system:

- clone the repository on your system.
- download the dataset and place it in "Dataset" folder.
- create a python virtual environment.(optional)
- install required packages using following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt # to be uploaded soon
```

and you are ready to Rock and Roll with the code.
